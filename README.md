# landing_page

In this learning project, I will adapt an image given by "The Odin Project" of an example
of a landing page trying to make it appear similar to it.

My adaptation of the landing page will be about a travel to Morocco in a four wheels drive
car, adding some photos and any comment about the trip.

The main goal of this project is to respect the original structure and how the landing page
looks.
